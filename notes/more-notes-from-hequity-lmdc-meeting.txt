More notes from LMDC meeting



Hey guys – I got a little more loosely structured info on some of the charges and dispositions, since we were unable to get the detailed codebook.  This comes from notes from a conversation someone else on the team had and shared.
 
 
Why would a person be held for a non-criminal offense? I was also curious how ordinance based charges are different from criminal charges; other; violation.
•	KY permits cash bond on any offence which is somewhat unique.  
•	Judges in Louisville (and across the state) will often set bonds on traffic ticket cases and extradite people across the state. 
  
What is the charge disposition related to animals? 
•	Dog bite cases where people don't properly license their animal.
 
Criminal mischief?
•	misdemeanor offense class b
 
Felony other? 
•	Likely just means a circuit court is holding the person and the jail isn’t sure what's going on yet.
 
Shock probation? 
•	The court has ordered someone to be present for a hearing for their lawyer to argue for their release from prison and enables attorneys to meet clients face to face and talk before arguing for release  
 
Rocket docket? 
•	Cases where the person is quickly resolving the matter through a program called rocket docket- always a felony matter
 
“Sentenced weekender?”
•	Not commonly done in Louisville but it is allowed for someone to serve their sentence only on weekends.
